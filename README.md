## Goals of recreating the site
* Start a movement going to use open-source software to build the country
* Use the movement to help Ethiopians become programmers and have work experience outside of actual work
* Re-host the site so that it doesn't go down when Internet is down in Ethiopia
* Keep the site up-to-date with nice Django-based interface for constant updates
* Make the site usable and useful
* Redesign the site to make it visually appealing
* Create a high standard for government sites (with support for multiple languages, giving citizens info and a voice through sites etc.)
