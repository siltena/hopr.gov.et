This text tries to describe features of the parliamentary systems introduced by the regimes ruled the country.<br />Parliament during the reign of Emperor Haile Sillasie ́ (Autocracy rule)-1930-74)<br />The first written constitution was introduced during the reign of Empror Haile Sillasie. The people did not participate in the draft as well as ratification of the constitution as Emperor conferred it to his people as a gift at his coronation, in 1931. The 1931 constitution established the first parliament in the history of the country. The parliament was bicameral legislature: Yehig Mewossagna Mikir Bet (the Senate) (Upper House) and Yehig Memria Mikir Bet (Chamber of Deputies) (Lower House).<br />The Emperor elected advisors of Yehig Mewossagna Mikir Bet who had long served the government as aristocracy, magistrate, minister and military leader. As regards of Yehig Memria Mikir Bet Advisors, they were supposed to have estate as a warranty. However, it is not permissible to the wealthy populace.<br />Each House had 56 members. Every bill would not be enacted as a law unless,the two Houses deliberated upon and the will of emperor heard. In Nov. 3, 1931, the Houses commenced their works in the current palace; two years later, shifted to the present building of the parliament.<br />After the end of Italian occupation, since 1943, 5 members from each provinces had been selected forYehig Mewossagna Mikir Bet ; in sum they were 60.By the decision of the Emperor, 30 members elected for Yehig Memria Mikir Bet. The number of MPs for the Houses was 90 ( 60 Yehig Mewossagna and 30 Yehig Memria) .The first constitution was in service for 24 years until amendment to it had been made in 1955.As a result of which, it was decided that the public to elect members of Yehig Memria Mikir Bet. Accordingly, 125 and 250 members had been elected for Yehig Memria and for Yehig Mewossagna respectively. The parliament transformed from advisory status to legislative.<br />It was after the revised constitution that standing committees were set up to scrutinize and lodge issues to the parliament for resolutions. The revised constitution shows that<br />2<br />there existed constitutional bodies: Council of the Crown, Council of Ministers, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The constitution revised again before the emperor removed from power on September 1, 1974; however, the emperor ousted from by military junta before the constitution came in to effect. When the military dictatorial Dergue assumed state power through coup d&rsquo;état, dissolved the parliament.<br />The National Shengo( the Assembly) of the Dergue (military Junta)- 1974-91)<br />The Dergue, under the Provisional Military Government ruled the country for 13 years without constitution. The military junta transformed to a party system as it did set up workers party of Ethiopia (WPE) and purported to have been a civil government. The Dergue adopted a constitution in line with Marxist-Leninist ideology and proclaimed Ethiopian People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic (EPDR) constitution on Sep. 12, 1987. The WPE ruled the country solely occupying the National Assembly seats. The National Assembly had 5 years tenure; it was established by members elected from 835 constituencies. According to the provision of the PDRE constitution, the Shengo conducted its sitting once a year; unto year, council of government sorted out issues to have been decided by the National Shengo. The Shengo was unicameral legislature oriented to socialist principle and based on one party rule; it did outlaw a multiparty system.<br />Ethiopian Peoples&rsquo; Revolutionary Democratic Front (Democratic Government)-1991---)<br />Council of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia( June 1991-July1995)<br />Following the down fall of the Dergue regime by the EPRDF in armed struggle, on May 1991, EPRDF called upon political forces that fought to topple down the Dergue.The Council of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia was formed as an outcome of Peace and Democratic Transition Conference of Ethiopia held in Addis Ababa from July 1-5, 19 91. The conference approved a Charter by which the Council directed. The charter set up House of Representatives and Council of Ministers. The House of Representatives was legislative; its members were from various political forces: political parties, movements and armed forces.<br />3<br />The House had 86 members, of which 3 were women. The content and mission of charter had geared to dissolute oppressive institutions of the former government, ensure the right and benefit of the disadvantaged group, redress as well as renounce the past predicament, and also succeed the transition programme. The House was in office for four years term; its main mission had been to arrange for the establishment of permanent democratic government. Accordingly, it did set up constitutional commission that prepared a draft constitution. The draft constitution augmented with public opinion and eventually on Dec. 8, 1994, the FDRE constitution has been adopted by the members of constitutional council elected by the people for this purpose. In conformity with the constitution, in May 1995, His Excellency Mr. Meles Zenawi, who had been president of Transitional Government, was elected, the FDRE prime minister. Peaceful and democratic transition of political power to the government elected by the people succeeded, and the transitional period came to an end.
