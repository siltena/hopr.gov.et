## What is hopr.gov.et?
The goal of the project is to deliver a fully designed web application to the content delivery team at HOPR. The content delivery team are the end-users
for us as they are the ones that will organize the content using the admin panels, tools etc. that we create, set it up on the server and provide it for users.
